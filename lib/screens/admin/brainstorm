  Read deep once at admin portal and build children objects for other screens?
  Read shallow at admin portal and send req when loading other screens?  ---

Admin portal
  Future: /aircraft => [Aircraft] => Gridview.builder((idx) {return buildTile(aricrafts[i])})
  Search: searchBox(onChange: setState((){filterList()}))
    void filterList(){
      var ret = <String>[];
      aircrafts.foreach((x) {if(x.name.startswith(searchtext){ret.add(x)})})
    }
  Create: Nav.push()
